## About Me 🚀
I'm a Technical Program Manager at Amazon with 22+ years experience in Software Development, Project/Program Management, Agile Coaching/Management and Product development. I began my career as a Java developer, dabbled in all areas of software development using Core Java, JSP/Servlets, J2ME, Swing, EJB 2.0/3.0, Spring Boot etc. I earned the SCJP and SCWCD certifications way back then. Off late I have not been in core programming roles, but I love learning new skills and trying out new tech. I current hold the Certified Scrum Master, SAFe Agilist, Profesional Product Owner, PMP, ITIL, AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Certifified Solutions Architect Associate certifications. I also completed a [Professional Certificate Program in Product Management](https://iimkozhikode.emeritus.org/iimk-professional-certificate-programme-in-product-management) from [IIM Kozhikode](https://www.iimk.ac.in/) and am a [Certified Product Manager](https://productschool.com/product-manager-certification) from the [Product School](https://productschool.com/).

I have been one of the earfliest of Hindi bloggers from India and dablle in content creation  since 2002. I used to blog at [Null Pointer](http://nullpointer.debashish.com) in English and at *[Nuktachini](http://nuktachini.debashish.com)* in Hindi, these are seldom updated now. I founded India's first (and only) desi blog awards [Indibloggies](http://indibloggies.blogspot.com) and the first Hindi blog aggregator *[Chittha Vishwa](http://www.myjavaserver.com/~hindi/)*, Hindi webzines *[Nirantar](http://nirantar.org)* and *[Samayiki](http://samayiki.com)*, and Hindi podcast [Podbharati](http://podbharati.com). I have contributed to the localization of multiple pieces of software. I have been instrumental in beginning initiatives like *[Buno Kahani](http://bunokahani.blogspot.com)*, a group blog where various authors literally weave a story and *[Anugunj](https://web.archive.org/web/20080509161849/http://akshargram.com/sarvagya/index.php/Anugunj)*, a web event hosted in turn by Hindi bloggers where various bloggers write on a given topic. 

I presently publish the newsletters [Podcast Round-up](http://parikrama.substack.com) (in Hindi) and [The Agile Chronicles](https://medium.com/the-agile-chronicles). [Click here](http://nullpointer.debashish.com/about/about-the-author) if you are interested to know more about me.
